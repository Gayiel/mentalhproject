## üìù Problem Statement Verification

Users should understand these 3 things in first 10 seconds:

### 1. **The Problem**
**Current text**:
> "Crisis moments often hide in plain language. When someone says 'I can't do this anymore' or 'Everyone would be better off without me,' we might miss the urgency. **Delayed recognition = delayed help.**"

**Ask a test user**: "What problem does this app solve?"
- Expected answer: "It catches hidden crisis language in conversations"

### 2. **The Approach**
**Current text**: 4 capabilities shown:
- ü§ñ AI emotional analysis
- üìä Multi-pattern detection
- ü§ù Human expert review
- ‚ö° Instant escalation

**Ask a test user**: "How does it work?"
- Expected answer: "AI analyzes conversations, humans review, connects to help"

### 3. **The Impact**
**Current text**: 3 value propositions:
- ‚è±Ô∏è Faster Detection
- üéØ Better Escalation
- üí¨ Never Missed

**Ask a test user**: "Why should I use this?"
- Expected answer: "It's faster, more accurate, catches things humans miss"
