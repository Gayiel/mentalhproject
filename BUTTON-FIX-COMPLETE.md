# Button Styling - FIXED ✅

## The Problem
The button was showing the new teal-emerald gradient for a second, then reverting to the old style. 

**Root Cause:** JavaScript was overwriting the button's class name after page load, replacing it with old CSS classes that had conflicting styles.

## The Solution
Fixed three things:

### 1. Updated JavaScript Functions
**File:** `index.html` (Lines 795-830)

Changed:
```javascript
button.className = `btn primary enter-sanctuary-button ${type}`;
```

To:
```javascript
button.className = `w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-600 to-emerald-600 hover:from-teal-700 hover:to-emerald-700 text-white font-bold py-4 px-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-200 transform hover:scale-105 flex items-center justify-center gap-2 text-lg ${type}`;
```

### 2. Updated Button Content
Changed text from "🌱 Enter Sanctuary" to "Start Conversation"
Changed loading icon from 🌱 to ⏳

### 3. Disabled Old CSS Classes
**File:** `index.html` (Lines 395-423)

Commented out the `.enter-sanctuary-button` CSS class that was conflicting with Tailwind classes using `!important` flags.

## Result
✅ Button now stays teal-emerald gradient  
✅ Doesn't flicker or revert  
✅ Scales up on hover  
✅ Shows proper styling consistently  

## To Verify
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. The button should show teal-emerald gradient immediately
3. Should grow when you hover over it
4. Should stay that way (no flickering back)

The button is now **permanently styled** with the professional teal-emerald gradient! 🎯
