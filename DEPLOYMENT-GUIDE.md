```
project/
├── login.html (entry point for new users)
├── collaborative-mental-health.html (main app)
├── index.html (optional landing page)
├── js/
│   ├── auth-system.js
│   ├── collaborative-ai-system.js
│   ├── onboarding.js
│   └── accessibility.js (optional)
├── css/
│   ├── onboarding-styles.css
│   └── styles.css
├── PRIVACY-POLICY.md
├── SECURITY-PRACTICES.md
├── TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md (create)
└── README.md (update with login info)
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

**Development**:
```
protocol: http://
domain: localhost:3000
HTTPS: Not required
debug: True (console logs enabled)
encryption: XOR (demo)
```

**Production** (required):
```
protocol: https://
domain: your-domain.com
HTTPS: Required (TLS 1.2+)
debug: False (no console logs)
encryption: AES-GCM (upgrade from XOR)
rate-limit: 5 attempts / 15 minutes per IP
```

### Step 4: Deployment Steps

#### For Web Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

1. **Upload Files**
   ```bash
   # Upload all files to hosting platform
   login.html
   collaborative-mental-health.html
   js/
   css/
   *.md (documentation)
   ```

2. **Configure HTTPS**
   - Most platforms auto-enable (Netlify, Vercel)
   - Verify certificate is valid
   - Force HTTPS redirect

3. **Set Security Headers**
   ```
   netlify.toml (if Netlify):
   
   [[headers]]
     for = "/*"
     [headers.values]
       X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
       X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
       X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
       Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
       Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"
   ```

4. **Test Deployment**
   - Visit login.html
   - Register new test account
   - Login successfully
   - Access main app
   - Verify session works

#### For Self-Hosted (VPS, On-Premise)

1. **Server Setup**
   ```bash
   # 1. Install Node.js (if using node backend)
   # 2. Setup HTTPS certificate (Let's Encrypt)
   # 3. Configure firewall (ports 80, 443 open)
   # 4. Setup backup system
   ```

2. **Deploy Files**
   ```bash
   git clone your-repo.git /var/www/mindflow
   cd /var/www/mindflow
   npm install (if needed)
   ```

3. **Web Server Configuration** (nginx)
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       server_name mindflow.your-domain.com;
       
       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mindflow.your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mindflow.your-domain.com/privkey.pem;
       ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
       
       # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
       if ($scheme != "https") {
           return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
       }
       
       root /var/www/mindflow;
       index login.html;
       
       # Security headers
       add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";
       add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
       add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
       
       # Route all requests to login.html (SPA)
       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ /login.html;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Enable Auto-Renewal** (Let's Encrypt)
   ```bash
   certbot renew --dry-run
   # Test renewal before full deployment
   ```

---

## 🔐 SECURITY HARDENING

### Pre-Production: Must-Do's

1. **Upgrade Encryption**
   ```javascript
   // Current: XOR (demo only)
   // Upgrade to: AES-GCM
   
   // In auth-system.js, replace encrypt() method:
   async encrypt(text) {
       const algorithm = { name: 'AES-GCM', iv: new Uint8Array(12) };
       const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey('raw', this.encryptionKey, algorithm, false, ['encrypt']);
       const encoded = new TextEncoder().encode(text);
       const encrypted = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(algorithm, key, encoded);
       return btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(encrypted)));
   }
   ```

2. **Upgrade Password Hashing**
   ```javascript
   // Current: SHA-256 (weak for passwords)
   // Upgrade to: PBKDF2
   
   async hashPassword(password) {
       const encoder = new TextEncoder();
       const salt = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16));
       const key = await crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
           { name: 'PBKDF2', salt, iterations: 100000, hash: 'SHA-256' },
           await crypto.subtle.importKey('raw', encoder.encode(password), 'PBKDF2', false, ['deriveKey']),
           { name: 'AES-GCM', length: 256 },
           true,
           ['encrypt']
       );
       return { hash: btoa(String.fromCharCode(...salt)), key };
   }
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting** (backend)
   ```javascript
   // Add rate limiting to prevent brute force
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   
   const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
       windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
       max: 5, // 5 attempts
       message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later'
   });
   
   app.post('/login', loginLimiter, handleLogin);
   ```

4. **HTTPS Only**
   ```javascript
   // In auth check:
   if (window.location.protocol !== 'https:') {
       console.error('HTTPS required in production');
       alert('This app requires a secure connection (HTTPS)');
   }
   ```

5. **Content Security Policy** (CSP)
   ```html
   <!-- Add to <head> -->
   <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
         content="default-src 'self'; 
                  script-src 'self' https://cdn.tailwindcss.com;
                  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.tailwindcss.com;
                  connect-src 'self';
                  img-src 'self' data:;
                  font-src 'self';
                  object-src 'none';
                  base-uri 'self';
                  form-action 'self'">
   ```

## 👥 USER MANAGEMENT

### Creating Test Accounts

```
Test Account 1:
- Email: user1@example.com
- Password: TestPassword123!
- Name: Test User

Test Account 2:
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: AdminPassword456!
- Name: Administrator
```

### Testing Data Isolation

```javascript
// Verify users cannot see each other's data:

1. Login as user1@example.com
2. Send message: "This is user 1's data"
3. Logout
4. Clear session: localStorage.removeItem('mindflow_session')
5. Login as user2@example.com
6. Check message history
7. Expected: Empty (not showing user 1's messages)
8. Send message: "This is user 2's data"
9. Verify only 1 message in history

✓ If only user 2's message visible = Isolation working
✗ If user 1's message visible = SECURITY ISSUE
```
