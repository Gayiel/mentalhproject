## 🧪 TESTING

### Authentication Tests

```javascript
// Test 1: Registration
1. Go to login.html
2. Click "Sign Up"

3. Expected: Logged in, redirected to main app

// Test 3: Session Expiry
1. Login successfully
2. Wait 1 hour (or edit localStorage to set expiry to past)
3. Expected: Redirect to login, "session expired"

// Test 4: Data Isolation
1. Login as user1, send message
2. Logout
3. Login as user2
4. Expected: Cannot see user1's message
```

### Crisis Detection Tests

```javascript
// Test 1: Keyword Detection

## 📊 AUDIT & COMPLIANCE

### What's Logged

Every action is logged for compliance:

```
✅ User registration (email, timestamp)
✅ Login attempts (success/failure, reason)
✅ Logout (timestamp)
✅ Password resets (initiated, completed)
✅ Account deletion (timestamp, user ID)
✅ Crisis events (message, AI score, action)
✅ Session creation/expiry (timing)
✅ Profile updates (what changed)
```

### Accessing Logs

```javascript
// In browser console:
const logs = window.authSystem.getAuditLog(100);
console.table(logs);
// Shows last 100 events with timestamps
```

### Data Export (GDPR)

```javascript
// User can request all their data:
// Settings → Profile → (check browser console)
const userData = window.authSystem.exportUserData(userId);
// Returns: user profile + all conversations
```

---

## 🛠️ CUSTOMIZATION

### Changing Crisis Keywords

Edit `js/collaborative-ai-system.js`:
```javascript
const crisisKeywords = [
    // Add your custom keywords here
    'kill myself',
    "can't do this",
    'nobody cares',
    // ... more keywords
];
```

### Changing Resource Numbers

Edit `collaborative-mental-health.html`:
```javascript
// Find crisis resources section
'**Crisis Centers Near You:**
• National Crisis Line: 988 (change if needed)
• Your Local Center: XXX-XXX-XXXX (add here)
```

### Styling/Branding

Edit `css/styles.css`:
```css
/* Change primary color */
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;  /* Change to your brand color */
    --secondary-color: #764ba2;
}
```
