# Current Status: What's Working ✅

## Crisis Detection System
✅ **Working** - Detects all suicidal ideation language (subtle and explicit)

**Keywords covered:**
- Explicit: "suicide", "kill myself", "end it all"
- Subtle: "can't do this anymore", "nobody cares", "everyone would be better"
- Exhaustion: "too tired", "can't take it", "exhausted"
- Hopelessness: "no point", "worthless", "nothing matters"

**When detected:**
1. Crisis alert shows immediately
2. Phone (988), text (741741), chat links displayed
3. Human crisis specialist notified
4. Emergency options offered

## System Components
